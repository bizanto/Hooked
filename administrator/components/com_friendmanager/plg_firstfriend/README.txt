Thank you for using our plugin FIrst Friend.

If you intend to use any of the advanced features
they must be activated using a test account that you
you do not wish to have any friends added to, DO NOT
use an active acount to activate any advanced features.

The reason being is due to how the friend requests system
is set up you can not send a request to yourself which
all of the advanced features run through loops and your ID 
comes up within the loop, we have added extra protection to 
simply not send a request to or from the user running the advanced
features.

Also Note we have added a Backup routing whenever anything is done
that affects your connection table, please keep in mind it is a 
one time Undo. meaning it will continue to take backups of what your 
doing but when you enable it, it undoes the last thing you did. you can 
not go back 2 or 3 steps and undo something you did, so please tread lightly 
and test, test ,test before using these features.
